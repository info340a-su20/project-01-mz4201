    <h1>Project Proposal</h1> 
    <p>Will be working with ZeHua Zhu and XiaoTong Wang as a group.</p>

        <h2>Problem Domain</h2>
        <p>COVID-19 is a severe respiratory disease that is infectious. It has caused a global pandemic and leads to 
            months of self-quarantine, as well as businesses and public facilities shutting down. As the infection 
            gets more under control, cities in the United States set up guidelines to reopen in phases. People also 
            need to follow sanitation guidelines in public. </p>
        <p>Each business share their information to customers on social media, sending emails or posted in their store. 
            Each time someone wants to visit a place, they will need to check all these sources and chances are the 
            information is not updated. <a href="https://google.com/maps">Google Map</a> is usually a reliable source 
            to check the operation time but it requires certain person to update the time. Restaurant operation hours 
            can be shown on <a href="https://yelp.com">yelp</a> but the issue is not all restaurant update their hours. 
            And they only shows the operation time. They don't have any other information regarding to COVID-19. </p>
        <p>Other than the operation time, each business customizes their sanitation guidelines and their COVID-19 response. 
            For example, <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/">Trader Joe's</a> does not allow customers to use their own 
            reusable shopping bags while other shops still allow them. This may be nice to know ahead.</p>
        <p class='proposal'>What if there is a web application that can show the most updated confirmed operation time, store guidelines, and business's response to COVID?</p>
        <p>The users don't have to look through several media platforms to get the information. They don't have to go to the business and realize they should or should not bring something.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>The users will be anyone who is planning to leave the house and visit a public place. They can either enter a location are to look for businesses near by or enter the name of the business. It will be presented in the format of map or list.
            When the user click on the business, it will display the basic information such as address and phone numbers. It will also show the most updated operation time, business disclosure of their response to COVID-19 and their sanitation guidelines.
            Other than viewing the information, the business owners or the users can submit an update to the information as the phases change. Business can update information immediately or the most frequently submitted by users will update as well.
            Most of the data, such as locations or maps can be from incorporating a map app. The COVID-19 related information will be from users.
        </p>
        <p>With the submition system of updating the information, the users can view the most recent and confirmed operation time, guidelines and responses on a single platform. They don't have to search through several platforms which can be time-saving and make it efficient.</p>
